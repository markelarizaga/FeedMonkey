TinyRSS
==========

A Firefox OS and Firefox for Android client app for [TinyTinyRSS](http://tt-rss.org) server.

This app lets you connect to a Tiny Tiny RSS instance and navigate the existing categories and feeds
tree. It keeps the same structure found in the server. Articles of each feed can be navigated using
right and left swipe gestures.

It is possible to put the app in an offline mode, which allows users to download a subset of the
articles from the server and read them without requiring an active network connection. The read
status of the articles will be synchronized once the app goes back online.

Currently the app supports 3 languages: English, Spanish and Basque.

Please keep in mind that in order to use this app a working [TinyTinyRSS](http://tt-rss.org) server
is needed.

Contributions are welcome!
