TinyRSS
==========

RSS client for Firefox OS

A RSS mobile client with which you can read your RSS feeds and mark them as read on your server. 

- You swipe right and left to navigate through the articles.
- Works also offline.

This is not a stand alone application. To use this RSS client to read your feeds you need a [TinyTinyRSS](http://tt-rss.org) backend server.
